                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">REST is great for resource-oriented architectures with simple data requirements.

                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">GraphQL shines when you have complex, nested data requirements. It solves the 'over-fetching' and 'under-fetching' problems by allowing the client to request exactly the data it needs. This reduces network usage, crucial for mobile apps.</p>
                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">However, GraphQL prevents simple HTTP caching and adds complexity to the backend.
