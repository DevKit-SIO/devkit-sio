                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">State management is the heart of any robust Flutter application. Whether you choose BLoC, Riverpod, or Provider, consistency is key. Separating your business logic from your UI code ensures that your application remains maintainable as it grows. Our <a href="/services/mobile-app-development" class="text-green-900 font-bold hover:underline">mobile development team</a> typically recommends clean architecture principles to separate data, domain, and presentation layers.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">One of common pitfalls in Flutter development is unnecessary widget rebuilds. Using 'const' constructors, properly sizing images, and leveraging list virtualization are essential for maintaining that buttery-smooth 60fps performance.</p>
                <p class="mb-6 md:mb-9">Testing is another non-negotiable. Flutter's comprehensive testing suite allows for unit, widget, and integration tests. A robust CI/CD pipeline, often set up by our <a href="/services/devops" class="text-green-900 font-bold hover:underline">DevOps experts</a>, ensures that every commit is verified before it reaches your users.</p>

We typically advise a phased approach: re-host (lift and shift), re-platform (tinker), or re-factor (rewrite). Re-factoring for microservices offers the greatest long-term benefits but requires the most effort.
